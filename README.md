## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.

## Main Project

Journaling might be the most underrated activity that can boost your productivity and well-being in just a few minutes a day. Just jot your thoughts down or record what happened during the day for a simple way to manage stress, enhance creativity, increase happiness, improve health, and increase work performance.
For the back end, I have used Node js, Express, EJS, MongoDB and for the front end HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript and it's a responsive website.


## Deploying your project

There are a number of ways to host your project for free. I am using [Heroku](https://heroku.com) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. And to manage database I am using MongoDB Atlas as it is global cloud database service for modern applications. Deploy fully managed MongoDB across AWS, Azure, or GCP.
